we started off wishing for some kind of "fun" environment to develop "fun" games...

have we learned something in the process of development that may change original intent?

	we have not begun sketchup w/ "object personality" yet, that was supposed to be fun
	we have nothing that "looks like it might be fun to hit with flippers"
	
	ACAD not started
	ACAD export not started
	sounds not started
	sound engine not started
	rules not done
	PShop not started
	physics objects not done
	
	"simple" camera is completely missing
	any font/notification fx completely missing
	
so, to address;
	
	DONE write switch routines and test
	think of 5 different things to do with camera and implement a camera system
		DONE follow 1 ball (this is same as next item)
		DONE follow lowest ball in multi-ball
		DONE zoom level
		"swirl in" to playfield on game start "effect"
		fade-in / out ""
		focus on single point w/ zoom
	think of 3 different ways to present / position text and implement ""
	
	write sound engine
	write target, pop bumper, slingshot, post, rubber/rail/guide
	design a playfield with a couple of each
	design rules for target points + bonus points + bonus multiplier
	share & enjoy
