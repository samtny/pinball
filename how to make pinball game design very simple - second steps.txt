we have a render pipeline, physics, input, now what?

big "question marks" are;

-texture loading?????
-score / text / overlay display

re; score / overlays;
	score at any position + size combo desired
	overlays may include texture + text
	positions like "top middle", etc., some kind of markup
	furthermore;
		i would like text to appear the same on all platforms
