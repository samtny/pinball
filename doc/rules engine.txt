the lua "rules" may call;
	sound engine
	physics engine ("resetMechs")
	native, such as game over
	
the lua "rules" may be called by;
	physics engine ("switchClosed")
	native engine ("startButtonPressed")

this must be managed by "X";
	lua "rules" calls "X", "X" parcels to physics AND NATIVE...
	physics calls "X", "X" parcels to rules AND NATIVE...
	native calls "X", "X" parcels to rules and physics (e.g. "pause")

possible paths;
	physics -> X -> bridge -> sound
	physics -> X -> rules
	rules -> X -> physics
	rules -> X -> bridge -> sound
	ui -> physics
	ui -> rules
