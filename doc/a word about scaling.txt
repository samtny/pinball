a word about scaling

scaling;

texture size
	-auto by opengl





==============================

it should be possible to "auto-scale" all figures, but this is perhaps not ideal.

we will use one set of units to "design" objects
the physics model should translate these units into reasonably accurate "sizes"
	this translation should be specified manually somewhere, perhaps in "config.lua"
the render engine...
	currently gets position data from the physics engine
	should translate the desired viewable space into screen coordinate space
		e.g.; if "box width" zoom level is desired, take "viewport width / box width" as multiplier
