nearing completion, we have following areas to complete for "very simple" game design platform;

1) playfield design, "tagging", export to layout.lua
	-"insert" new object
		- problem of "scaling" window -> physics model
			- camera does it by taking windowW / activeCameraMode.w
				- but acm.w is pre-scaled here...
					- scale which is loaded from config.lua...
						- ok...
		
	-"copy" existing object
	-"undo"
	-export to layout.lua
2) pshop import wireframe, export prettiness
3) grab + munge sound fx
