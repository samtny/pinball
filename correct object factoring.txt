correct pinball object factoring

Happy New Year!

Problem;
	objects / pointers to objects / create/destroy / object loading / physical realization of objects are all over the place

Solution;

	can we get away with 1 copy of "objects"?
		what is appropriate "parent"?
			i would say "game"...
				but perhaps it is "game->playfield"?
				does editor get its own "stack" of playfields?
					can still operate directly on "game" playfield as well...
				
	lua is in here somewhere...
	
	scaling is in here somewhere (scale in / out of engine should be transparent thru... ? object ? )
	
	so, it would be;
	
		init Playfield at top (just after Bridge)
		assign to "Physics"
		assign to "Camera" (?? whys??)
		assign to "Editor"
		assign to "Renderer"
		assign to "Game"
		
		away you go...
	
	what do we need lua for otherwise?
		- load Physics constants
		- load camera constants
		- load Editor constants (scale...?)
		- so perhaps keep "loadConfig()" around for a while here, look at later...
