once upon a time...

"multi-platform" is an unfortunate necessity.
"rapid prototyping" is much wanted.

the latter may be achieved through the use of scripting alone.

the former may be achived either through writing of multiple native engines, or through some sharing.

a native engine stub has (currently) undefined responsibility.

what may assuredly be done in shared land is as follows;
	draw a scene using opengl ES 1.1 and/or 2.0 compliant calls
	maintain a physics model
	
what may not be done in shared land;
	set up opengl context and keep a loop going
		-the latter largely due to glut, etc., issues
	set up audio context and queue sound data
	receive input from user
	invoke network calls

it may be possible in shared land to;
	queue audio indirectly via assigned function
		this may need to be via pimpl, as the native implementation is not known...
