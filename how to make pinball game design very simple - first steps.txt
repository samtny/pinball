how to make pinball game design very simple - first steps

to get started (e.g. test that Lua + C + physics engine + graphx engine + rulesheet all synch well together), do the following;

0) DONE conceive 2 flippers, 10 targets, a couple guides and a ball in a box of dimension NxM
1) DONE come up with coords for these
2) DONE write lua "materials" file
3) DONE write lua "objects" file, using some reasonable shape coords
4) DONE write lua "layout" file, anchoring reasonable objects in reasonable (arbitrary) space
5) DONE write lua "forces" file, gravity, left flipper / right flipper forces
6) write lua "objtranslate" file
7) DONE write lua "rules" file
8) ... write C physics engine init + for each object + lua "materials, objects, layout, forces, objtranslate" loads
9) DONE write C render engine using debugDraw (e.g. just draw "object" coords) to OpenGL-ish thingy-do (e.g. glut + opengl vanilla)
10) DONE  design and debug run cycle
11) tweak and test
12) DONE port to iPhone

THE END
