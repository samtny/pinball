how to make pinball game design very simple - first steps

to get started (e.g. test that Lua + C + physics engine + graphx engine + rulesheet all synch well together), do the following;

0) conceive 2 flippers, 10 targets, a couple guides and a ball in a box of dimension NxM
1) come up with coords for these
2) write lua "materials" file
3) write lua "objects" file, using some reasonable shape coords
4) write lua "layout" file, anchoring reasonable objects in reasonable (arbitrary) space
5) write lua "forces" file, gravity, left flipper / right flipper forces
6) write lua "objtranslate" file
7) write lua "rules" file
8) write C physics engine init + for each object + lua "materials, objects, layout, forces, objtranslate" loads
9) write C render engine using debugDraw (e.g. just draw "object" coords) to OpenGL-ish thingy-do (e.g. glut + opengl vanilla)
10) design and debug run cycle
11) tweak and test
12) port to iPhone

THE END
